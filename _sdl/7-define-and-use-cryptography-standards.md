Encryption is typically used to achieve this. Making an incorrect choice in the use of any aspect of cryptography can be catastrophic, and it’s best to develop clear encryption standards that provide specifics on every element of the encryption implementation. This should be left to experts. A good general rule is to only use industry-vetted encryption libraries and ensure they’re implemented in a way that allows them to be easily replaced if needed.

See Section 4.7 of the UCOP Secure Software Guidelines, which covers encryption standards for Web Applications.
