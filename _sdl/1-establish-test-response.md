An Incident Response Plan should be created in coordination with your organization’s dedicated
Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT).The plan should include who to contact
in case of a security emergency, and establish protocols for security servicing, including
plans for code inherited from other groups within the organization and for third-party code.
The incident response plan should be tested before it is needed!

Please check section 16 of the UCOP IS-3 guidelines
(<https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000543/BFB-IS-3>) for the minimum requirements for an
incident response plan.These requirements include all elements included in the UCOP
Information Security Response Standard, available at
<https://security.ucop.edu/files/documents/policies/incident-response-standard.pdf>

At UC Davis, security incidents should be reported to the Information Security Office
<https://iet.ucdavis.edu/security> via cybersecurity@ucdavis.edu. If private data is exposed
then the details should also be provided to the Privacy Office <https://privacy.ucdavis.edu/>
via privacy@ucdavis.edu.

# Document and test a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
No application can be made completely secure. If an application, server, or network is
compromised it may not be possible to fully recover from the production systems. Having a
fully documented and tested disaster recovery plan that allows an application or system to
be recovered or rebuilt from a secure, alternative location can make a big difference in
mitigating the severity of a security breach.

According to section 17 of the UCOP IS-3 guidelines
(<https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000543/BFB-IS-3>) Units must plan, implement, test and review
the continuity of information security as an integral part of the Unit’s business continuity and
disaster recovery plans.Units must also include IT Resources classified at Availability Level
4 in emergency and disaster recovery planning. The goal is to maintain information security
during adverse situations and ensure that information security is embedded in UC’s
business continuity and/or disaster recovery processes.

Safety Services provides some useful resources for emergency and disaster planning
(<https://safetyservices.ucdavis.edu/article/emergency-management-plans-and-procedures>),
including:
* An Event and Crisis Management Guide
* An Emergency Action Plan template and guide
* The UC Ready tool for developing Business Continuity Plans

All DRP documents should include a recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point
objective (RPO). The first defines how quickly a system is expected to recover while the
second is a description of the application or system will look like when it has sufficiently
recovered. Each department may have different RTO and RPO values based on their
sensitivity level, risk appetite, and capabilities.

More DRP templates and guidance are provided by the Department of Homeland Security
through Ready.gov at <https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/IT>
