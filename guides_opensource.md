As a public university with a research mission and dedication to public service, the philosophies of open source software are natural for campus developers to follow where applicable.

## Software is Special
*Please note: The following text was copied from [http://research.ucdavis.edu/industry/ia/researchers/copyright/distributing-work/#special](http://research.ucdavis.edu/industry/ia/researchers/copyright/distributing-work/#special) on January 30, 2017.*

Software may be protected by both patent and copyright. Because copyright ownership is based on authorship, and because software is often developed by multiple programmers, copyright ownership of software developed in the course of research at UC Davis can be quite complex, as it can include faculty, current and past graduate students, undergraduates, and staff as well as visitors. For more information, see the [UC Policy on Copyright Ownership](http://copyright.universityofcalifornia.edu/ownership/index.html). Depending on the nature of the software, it may be more appropriate to complete a Record of Invention than a Proposal to Distribute ([both forms here](http://research.ucdavis.edu/industry/ia/researchers/policies-forms/)).

A common question is about “open source” (OS) licenses, which means simply that source code is available in some way, including under a secrecy agreement or at a cost. In the spirit of sharing our research for the public good, the concept is a good one. University policy is to encourage use of its intellectual property freely for academic and scholarly research, and to get a “fair return” when appropriate, such as on commercial distributions. However, there are hundreds of OS licenses, including some which don’t actually do what their reputation says. Therefore, some OS licenses are prohibited for use on Regents’-owned code.

For example, rather than encouraging broad, open use of source code, the “GPL” (GNU General Public License) and the Apache 2.0 put strict, permanent limits on redistribution. On the opposite end, the BSD (Berkeley Software Development), one of the original OS licenses, allows pretty much any use by anyone including allowing someone to commercialize code they didn’t write. That’s not acceptable for reasons related to research grants and the [public university licensing principles](http://research.ucdavis.edu/industry/ia/researchers/policies-forms/) which the University of California endorses.

The most common OS license used at UC Davis is a variation of the BSD, which allows free use by nonprofit research institutions without requiring a formal individual license, but directs potential commercial users to ask first in the event there should be limits or shared revenue is appropriate.

If you have used any code that you obtained elsewhere in your own code, even if you modified it heavily for your own use, you must know the license that applied to that code when you obtained it, as it may dictate/limit your distribution rights. As a general rule, while you may obtain and use code obtained under these OS licenses (except for the MPL), you may not (re)distribute code obtained under or using the following OS licenses without advance approval:

Apache 2.0 on
Common Public License (CPL)
Eclipse Public License 1.0
GNU General Public License 3.0 on (GPL)
Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL)
There are other OS licenses which allow sharing of source code without violating university policies.

A Material Transfer Agreement is not the right way to transfer software, as it does not use the proper legal copyright or proprietary protection language and can permanently damage our ability to share it.
