# appdev
Repository for the AppDev SIG website.

# How to use
The App Dev SIG website is written using the popular static site generator
"Jekyll", written in Ruby.

First, ensure you have the 'ruby' and 'gem' commands installed. Next,
ensure you have the popular Ruby package manager 'bundler' installed. If
you need to install it, try 'gem install bundler'.

Once you have those dependencies, at the project root, type 'bundle install'
to install all the needed dependencies.

After that, type 'jekyll serve' (or sometimes 'bundle exec jekyll serve')
to host the site on your local machine.

The command will output a local IP and port to visit in your web browser
to view the site.

Any changes made will be re-compiled on-the-fly.
