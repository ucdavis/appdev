Below are compiled notes of the meeting:

Announcements
-

- There is an open call for meeting ideas.
- Volunteers wanted for recording / live-streaming our meetings.

Federal Open Source Policy & UC Davis
-
Scott Kirkland lead a discussion concerning the new Federal Open Source policy and how it might apply to UC Davis. Some notes below:

- No personal opposition but legal and administrative concerns remain.
- UC CIO Tom Andriola expressed interest at UCCSC 2016 in open sourcing work done at UC campuses.
- Brian Donnelly mentioned that a specific copyright line should be used in UC projects: "Copyright Â© 20nn-nn The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus. All Rights Reserved."

On-Boarding Document Idea
-
Christopher Thielen introduced the idea of an "on-boarding" or "welcome" document for new developers. The document would serve the same purpose as welcome packets used in many other companies: get the employee up-to-speed quickly on common practices, procedures, and get them connected with a community quickly.

We are currently asking for feedback on the document. [It is located here]({{ site.baseurl }}/orientation/).

Development Workflow Presentation
-
Shawn DeArmond delivered a presentation on his team's workflow, from initial project meeting through
design, continuous integration, testing, and more.
