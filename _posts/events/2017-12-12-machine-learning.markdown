What is Machine Learning, Really?
-

Scott Kirkland gave a presentation on machine learning:

"Machine Learning is transforming our world faster than almost any other trend, touching many of our interactions today, from talking to Alexa to searching Google to getting Netflix recommendations and much, much more.  As technologists we have an exciting opportunity to understand, and even employ, Machine Learning techniques in our own work and as a way to recognize what is happening in the world around us as the technology advances."
