## Understanding Common Authentication Schemes

Learn how several critical authentication schemes used throughout the university system work in practice. You'll learn:

* How Shibboleth and SAML work together, and where InCommon fits into the picture.
* About CAS, Duo, and more.
* And of course, you'll learn about OAuth/OIDC, the most commonly used scheme in our industry (other than perhaps BASIC username/passwords).

We'll view practical examples of how each work, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We'll get into claims and information consent, which is a critical component of complete authentication and authorization systems.
