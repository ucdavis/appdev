# OWASP Top 10
#### 25 July 2016

[**O**pen **W**eb **A**pplication **S**ecurity **P**roject](https://owasp.org)

OWASP provides multiple resources for writing secure code; they also provide a Mobile Top 10 and IoT Top 10.

The OWASP Top 10 refreshes every three years; data here covers the OWASP 2013 Top 10 List, but most of the attacks stay the same from version to version. This list covers *attack families*, **not** individual attacks.
