title: The Developer Community at UCD
---

As of a survey in March 2016, UCD has an estimated 150 employees who are tasked with writing
source code most of their time. As many as 300 employees may write source code at least some of the time.

Developers have a few ways to find community:

 * The App Dev SIG (this website and its meetings)
 * The App Sec SIG (security focus with support from the UCD CISO office)
 * ucdavis.slack.com (#appdev channel, amongst others)
 * tsp-share mailing list (more IT-focused than developer engineering but good to watch)
