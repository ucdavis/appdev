title: Finding Example Source Code
---

Often time to solve a problem, you just need to adapt someone else's solution.
There's no shame in doing so: it saves time, teaches you new methods, and is
arguably the way culture and technology evolve.

Besides typical public resources like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com),
UCD specific source code can be found at [github.com/ucdavis](https://github.com/ucdavis)
and BitBucket. You should also feel free to ask for example source code from your
colleagues.

Notably, there is the UCD project registry found on this website. It will enable you
to see some projects for whom source code has been published and is cross-referenced by
relevant tags such as whether a project uses CAS, Banner, LDAP, etc. This will help
you find what you're looking for quickly.
