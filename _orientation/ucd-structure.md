title: UCD Structure Explained
---
UC Davis is a public university in the University of California higher education
system chartered by the California State Constitution. It receives funding
from the State of California, student tuition, donors, and through
specific research grants. *A developer position may be a permanent position or
it may be a temporary position funded by a grant.*

UCD is generally thought of as comprising of staff, students (both undergraduate
and graduate), faculty, and researchers. Though some areas of the University
are administered by staff, much of the University's administrative authority
ultimately comes from the faculty via the Academic Senate or from faculty-filled
positions (including the Office of the Chancellor).

The University itself is federated, consisting of colleges, schools, and other
units which receive some dictums from a central authority but retain much
independence in their operation. This allows various units to craft their
methodologies with a fitness suited to their purpose. This does create challenges
in collaboration however, as units are not forced to share code, share development
practices, and so on.

Some of these collaboration challenges are mitigated by SIGs (special interest groups) or other
community instruments which allow like-minded staff and
faculty to come together and share ideas and develop collaborations.

The UCD Developers' SIG is one such group. You can find more about it on our
[About](/about) page.
