## Our Mission Statement

> The UC Davis Application Developerâ€™s SIG provides a regular space and communication channel for campus developers to come together and learn new technologies, new techniques, understand software trends, and encourage collaboration. Our goal is to increase developer engagement, offer training opportunities, and improve overall software quality.
