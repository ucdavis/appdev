The UC Davis Application Developer's Special Interest Group (SIG) is a self-organized community group of UCD staff aiming to share knowledge and build community.

We hold meetings on the second Tuesday of every month and post the notes on this site.

This site also maintains a list of App Dev SIG members who have volunteered to be Subject Matter Experts in various technologies. Please feel free to contact them should you need assistance.
